# genetic-algorithm

This was an assignment from my Computational Intelligence in Business, Economics and Finance Module from my BSc at the University of Kent. In the file 'Modelling.java', there are 2 classes, oen titled 'modelling' and another titled 'GA'.

The class Modelling makes use of financial indicators on imported price data to create a model. The GA class is a genetic algorithm that produces a well performing rule using sequential covering. This would help the user make prediction for futuer stock movements based on the previous model generated.

The file 'Report.pdf' speaks about my overall results and findings from this assignment.
